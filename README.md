Its all about my experience(success and failures ) and knowledge which I gained while investing.
1. (Warren buffet is my mentor whatever i have learnt is the result of his teaching which i collected from different sources.

      1. Do deep analysis Of the sector in which you are going to start your invesment. 
      2. After deep analyis try to predict its prices (future)
      3. YOu wil found those sectors alos which are not progressing right now , but there is huge  probability that they will progress in the future . 
      4. This is not a battle of predictions all is the battle of analysis. The one who analyses better is going to be the winner of the game. So focus on analysis. 
      5. Now you can start investing in two situations
